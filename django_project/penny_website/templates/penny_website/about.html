          <p>Hi, Iâ€™m Penny. So glad that you found me here! :) I'm currently a M.S. Computer Science student and I will be graduating on December 2020.
          <p>Computer science has been something that I desperately want to persue for a long time. Before hopelessly falling down this rabbit hole, I was a Localization Engineer specialized in software, website, and multimedia localization. I had 5 years of professional enigneering experience on the vendor side and 2 years of Localization Project Management education (Master's). In my previous job, I had been using my python skills to automate tasks and reduced some tasks' processing time >90%, which served as the catalyst that pushed me closer to the Computer Science track. I also enjoyed working in a team environemnt with teams memebers spreading across time zones.</p>
          <p>I am constantly looking for opportunities and challenges that come my way! So please feel free to reach out to me at <span class="email"><a href="mailto:fangle0121@gmail.com">fangle0121@gmail.com</a></span> if there are any and I seem to be a good fit for them. I'm looking forward to hearing from you!</p>
